<P> There are 11 positions in soccer.Ten outfield players and one goalkeeper.The goalkeeper or goalie is the last player in the defensive backline and his/her main role is simply to prevent opposing players from getting the ball over the goal-line.The goal of defensive players is to stop the opponent’s attack, interfere with the creation of the opponent’s attack and prevent the opponent from scoring a goal.A midfielder in soccer is a player positioned in the center of the field between the defenders and the forwards. The role of a midfielder is to provide the link between the attack and the defense.A forward (attacker or striker) is an outfield position which primarily plays further up the pitch than midfielders and defenders.The role of the forward relies heavily on being able to create space for attack </P>
